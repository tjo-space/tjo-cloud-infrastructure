# This configuration should in theory:
#  a) Keep 5 full backups (last 5 days).
#  b) Keep Point-in-Time recovery of the  last 5 days.
#
#  At the time of writing this, each backup uses 9GB of space.
#  We have 70GB space locally. Which means we can store ~7 backups.
#  Configuring to 5 backups means we have space for the new backup (6th).
#
#  Restic maintains more snapshots, so we can restore more backups.
