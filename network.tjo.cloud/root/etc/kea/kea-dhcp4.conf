// This is a basic configuration for the Kea DHCPv4 server. Subnet declarations
// are mostly commented out and no interfaces are listed. Therefore, the servers
// will not listen or respond to any queries.
// The basic configuration must be extended to specify interfaces on which
// the servers should listen. There are a number of example options defined.
// These probably don't make any sense in your network. Make sure you at least
// update the following, before running this example in your network:
// - change the network interface names
// - change the subnets to match your actual network
// - change the option values to match your network
//
// This is just a very basic configuration. Kea comes with large suite (over 30)
// of configuration examples and extensive Kea User's Guide. Please refer to
// those materials to get better understanding of what this software is able to
// do. Comments in this configuration file sometimes refer to sections for more
// details. These are section numbers in Kea User's Guide. The version matching
// your software should come with your Kea package, but it is also available
// in ISC's Knowledgebase (https://kea.readthedocs.io; the direct link for
// the stable version is https://kea.readthedocs.io/).
//
// This configuration file contains only DHCPv4 server's configuration.
// If configurations for other Kea services are also included in this file they
// are ignored by the DHCPv4 server.

    //                       that Kea does not support out of the box yet)

    // These are global options. They are going to be sent when a client
